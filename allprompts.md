General Information

About Us
Our Mission
Since 1988, our mission is to serve our Lord, our community, and our customers. Our goal is to create a simple, easy, and enjoyable shopping experience. We strive to deliver a high level of value and service to help our customers achieve the home environment they desire. We are your friends and neighbors. Our roots are local, and we support our hometown. We aspire to create an environment for our associates that is fair and supportive.
When the Aaron family first opened Woodstock Outlet in 1988, they didn‚Äôt yet know where our journey would take us. Initially, JR discovered a business opportunity in acquiring and selling returns, overstocks, and scratch and dent items from well-known catalog merchants like Sears and Service Merchandise. Perhaps a few of y‚Äôall remember those early days!


With only a small 6,000 square foot store off of Hwy 5 in Woodstock, we sold everything from clothing, to car parts, and almost everything in between. Everything but furniture that is - at least not at first. Shortly after opening, we had the opportunity to expand into mattresses. And a year or two after that, we finally added our first pieces of closeout, overstock, and scratch and dent furniture. By 1994, we were completely committed to furniture, mattresses and home furnishings.


As the Woodstock area grew, so did we. Eventually we gained the reputation as the place around town to find great deals on furniture and mattresses, cementing our place as a fixture in our local community. And we have our loyal customers, our faith in God, our dedicated family, our down-to-earth atmosphere, and our hard-working, knowledgeable furniture and mattress experts to thank for that.

Obviously, a lot has changed since those days. First, we changed our name to Woodstock Furniture Outlet, and later to Woodstock Furniture & Mattress Outlet. We moved into our current 100,000 square foot flagship showroom in Woodstock/Acworth, opened stores in Dallas/Hiram, Rome, and Covington, and then two more mattress only stores in Canton and Douglasville. We also built a Distribution Center in Acworth to serve our customers more quickly and efficiently. All of these things have transformed us into the ‚ÄúHometown Furniture Superstore‚Äù that we are today. And, as of December 2021 the Aaron family made the employees the owners of Woodstock Furniture & Mattress Outlet.
 
But quite a few things haven‚Äôt changed. Our friendly, laid-back environment, our hands-on customer service, and our unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction are as critically important to us as ever! Today and in the future, we are dedicated to bringing our customers the best quality we can at our lowest possible price. The same as always. We hope to see you soon at Woodstock Furniture & Mattress Outlet!

Thank you Lord for your bountiful blessings, mercy, and grace.

Sincerely from our home to yours,
The Aaron Family & the new owners...the WFMO Team




























###Terms & Condition
##Terms and Conditions
Shipping Methods
We will ship your order using the most reliable, fastest and safest method possible. Every product on our site has been carefully identified to ship by a particular method in order to provide optimal delivery service at the most affordable price. For certain items - we ship within the 48 contiguous states. Please call us regarding expedited shipments or those made to Hawaii or Alaska. Please note: Deliveries cannot be made to a P.O. Box. An actual street address is required.
We have several methods of shipment available: Small Parcel, Freight Carrier and White Glove.
Small Parcel
When an item ships by Small Parcel, it means it will be delivered by UPS, FEDEX, DHL or USPS. Generally, signatures are not required at delivery but it is at the discretion of each delivery person. You may leave a note on your door advising "No Signature Required." Be sure to include your name and tracking number on the note.
It is important for you to inspect your shipment carefully. If damage is noted, do not assemble the product. Instead, notify us immediately (within 3-5 days of delivery). If the item is assembled, it may result in the denial of a replacement piece.
Freight Carrier
When shipping by Freight Carrier, it means the item is too heavy or too large to ship via the small parcel UPS/FedEx services so it will be sent to you by freight carrier. If your purchase is being delivered via a Freight service, you will be contacted by the Freight company via telephone 1-2 days prior to delivery to schedule a delivery appointment. You will need to be present to sign for the item.
Please note the following important details about Freight Delivery:
It is important for you to inspect your shipment carefully!
Any damage made to the carton or product itself, must be noted on the freight bill BEFORE the driver leaves. Please write "PRODUCT DAMAGED" on the sheet they ask you to sign. This ensures that if there is any damage, we can assist in correcting the matter.
If damage is noted, you may refuse the item or decide to keep it. Please note that keeping a defective item does not warrant a discount.
White Glove
This item will be delivered by a white glove freight carrier. White glove carriers provide the customer with many benefits throughout the delivery process. Unlike common freight carriers, white glove delivery service consists of a trained two person team that will assist in helping move your order from the truck into your home.
There are many levels of White Glove Delivery. We have chosen the premier service, Platinum Delivery, for our customers.
Platinum service level is the ideal choice for deliveries that demand not only placement, unpacking and debris removal, but up to 30 minutes of light assembly. An example of this service is the delivery of a bedroom set to the room of your choice, removal of all the packaging, assembly (attaching the headboard, footboard and rails) and the placement of the remaining furniture in the exact location you want.
Please note: This service includes carrying the product up two flights of stairs from the building threshold (4-15 steps = 1 flight). Having items carried up more than 25 steps and longer assembly periods are available as additional services which would require additional charges. Please contact us if you feel you need these services.
*In all cases the shipper will not hookup any electrical or component wires. It is important for you to inspect your shipment carefully!
Any damage made to the carton or product itself, must be noted on the freight bill BEFORE the driver leaves. Please write "PRODUCT DAMAGED" on the sheet they ask you to sign. This ensures that if there is any damage, we can assist in correcting the matter.
Returns and Damage
If you wish to return your order, you must do so within 5 days of receipt for an exchange or store credit only. Exludes mattresses, foundations, closeout, clearance, and floor models.
All items returned must be in new condition, unused, unassembled, unmodified and in the original packaging material. Please note: Made-to-order, personalized or custom-made items are subject to a 25% non-refundable deposit/restocking fee. Delivery and shipping costs are non-refundable. Customer is responsible for any return shipping costs.
 
If your order has shipped, it cannot be cancelled. If you refuse an order, it will then fall under our standard return policy where roundtrip shipping costs and applicable restocking fees will be deducted from your store credit/exchange credit.
Inspect Your Order for Damage or Missing Parts
It is important for you to inspect your shipment carefully.
If Shipped by Freight or White Glove:
Any damage made to the carton or product itself, must be noted on the freight bill before the driver leaves. Please write "PRODUCT DAMAGED" on the sheet they ask you to sign. This ensures that if there is any damage, we can assist in correcting the matter. If damage is noted, you may refuse the item or decide to keep it. Please note that keeping a defective item does not warrant a discount. If you refuse delivery, please notify us so we can expect the return shipment and send you a new one.
If you have already accepted the order and find that parts are missing or are damaged, please contact us immediately (within 24-48 hours) so we can ship replacement parts.
If Shipped by Small Parcel (UPS, FedEx, USPS)
It is important for you to inspect your shipment carefully. If damage is noted, do not assemble the product. Instead, notify us immediately (within 3-5 days of delivery). If the item is assembled, it may result in the denial of a replacement.
Made-to-Order, Personalized or Custom-Made Orders
Any item that is made-to-order, personalized or custom-made is not eligible for a refund. All sales are final. A return will not be accepted unless there was a manufacturing defect. If this occurred, please contact us immediately.

About Us
Our Mission
Since 1988, our mission is to serve our Lord, our community, and our customers. Our goal is to create a simple, easy, and enjoyable shopping experience. We strive to deliver a high level of value and service to help our customers achieve the home environment they desire. We are your friends and neighbors. Our roots are local, and we support our hometown. We aspire to create an environment for our associates that is fair and supportive.
When the Aaron family first opened Woodstock Outlet in 1988, they didn‚Äôt yet know where our journey would take us. Initially, JR discovered a business opportunity in acquiring and selling returns, overstocks, and scratch and dent items from well-known catalog merchants like Sears and Service Merchandise. Perhaps a few of y‚Äôall remember those early days!


With only a small 6,000 square foot store off of Hwy 5 in Woodstock, we sold everything from clothing, to car parts, and almost everything in between. Everything but furniture that is - at least not at first. Shortly after opening, we had the opportunity to expand into mattresses. And a year or two after that, we finally added our first pieces of closeout, overstock, and scratch and dent furniture. By 1994, we were completely committed to furniture, mattresses and home furnishings.


As the Woodstock area grew, so did we. Eventually we gained the reputation as the place around town to find great deals on furniture and mattresses, cementing our place as a fixture in our local community. And we have our loyal customers, our faith in God, our dedicated family, our down-to-earth atmosphere, and our hard-working, knowledgeable furniture and mattress experts to thank for that.

Obviously, a lot has changed since those days. First, we changed our name to Woodstock Furniture Outlet, and later to Woodstock Furniture & Mattress Outlet. We moved into our current 100,000 square foot flagship showroom in Woodstock/Acworth, opened stores in Dallas/Hiram, Rome, and Covington, and then two more mattress only stores in Canton and Douglasville. We also built a Distribution Center in Acworth to serve our customers more quickly and efficiently. All of these things have transformed us into the ‚ÄúHometown Furniture Superstore‚Äù that we are today. And, as of December 2021 the Aaron family made the employees the owners of Woodstock Furniture & Mattress Outlet.
 
But quite a few things haven‚Äôt changed. Our friendly, laid-back environment, our hands-on customer service, and our unwavering commitment to customer satisfaction are as critically important to us as ever! Today and in the future, we are dedicated to bringing our customers the best quality we can at our lowest possible price. The same as always. We hope to see you soon at Woodstock Furniture & Mattress Outlet!

Thank you Lord for your bountiful blessings, mercy, and grace.

Sincerely from our home to yours,
The Aaron Family & the new owners...the WFMO Team
