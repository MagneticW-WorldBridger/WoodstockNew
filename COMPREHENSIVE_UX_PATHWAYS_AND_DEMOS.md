Humans are unpredictable, emotional, and have varying levels of tech literacy. Our system must handle:
- **Happy Path Users** (everything works perfectly)
- **Frustrated Users** (things went wrong)
- **Confused Users** (don't know what they want)
- **Impatient Users** (want instant results)
- **Tech-Savvy Users** (try to break things)
- **Non-Tech Users** (need hand-holding)

### **DEMO 2: COMPREHENSIVE CUSTOMER WORKFLOW**

**Scenario:** Customer with multiple concerns and questions

```
üë© CUSTOMER: Hi! I bought a sectional from you guys recently and I have some questions about it

ü§ñ SYSTEM: Hello! Welcome to Woodstock Furniture support. I'd be happy to help with your sectional questions! 

To give you the best assistance, could you please share your phone number or email address? This will help me quickly find your order and provide specific information about your purchase.

üë© CUSTOMER: Sure, my phone is 407-288-6040. I have questions about the power recliners - they seem to be making a noise

ü§ñ SYSTEM: Thank you, Janice! I found your order for the beautiful Repose Avenue 6 Piece Sectional in Defender Sand that was delivered on July 12th.

I'm sorry to hear about the noise from your power recliners. This can sometimes happen and is usually fixable! Let me help you troubleshoot:

**What type of noise are you hearing?**
‚Ä¢ Clicking/ticking sound
‚Ä¢ Humming or motor noise  
‚Ä¢ Grinding or scraping
‚Ä¢ Squeaking

**When does it happen?**
‚Ä¢ Only when reclining
‚Ä¢ Only when returning upright
‚Ä¢ Continuously while in motion
‚Ä¢ Even when not in use

The more details you can share, the better I can help!

üë© CUSTOMER: It's like a clicking sound, and it happens when I'm reclining back. Only on the right side recliner. Also, I wanted to ask about cleaning - what products should I use?

ü§ñ SYSTEM: Thank you for those details, Janice! 

**üîß CLICKING SOUND SOLUTION:**
The clicking during reclining is usually caused by:
1. **Normal break-in period** - New mechanisms can make sounds for first few weeks
2. **Loose connection** - Easy fix with tightening
3. **Debris in track** - Simple cleaning needed

**IMMEDIATE STEPS:**
1. Check if anything is caught in the recliner track
2. Try reclining slowly and smoothly (avoid quick motions)
3. The sound should diminish as the mechanism breaks in

If it persists after 2 weeks, we'll send a technician at no charge!

**üßΩ CLEANING YOUR DEFENDER SAND FABRIC:**
‚Ä¢ **Regular maintenance:** Vacuum weekly with upholstery attachment
‚Ä¢ **Spot cleaning:** Use mild soap and water, blot don't rub
‚Ä¢ **Deep cleaning:** Professional cleaning every 12-18 months
‚Ä¢ **Avoid:** Bleach, harsh chemicals, excessive water

**RECOMMENDED PRODUCTS:**
‚Ä¢ Scotchgard Fabric Protector (reapply every 6 months)
‚Ä¢ Woolite Upholstery Cleaner for spots
‚Ä¢ Soft-bristled brush for texture maintenance

Would you like me to send you a detailed care guide via email?

üë© CUSTOMER: Yes please! Also, I'm thinking about getting a matching ottoman. Do you have any that would work with this set?

ü§ñ SYSTEM: ‚úÖ **CARE GUIDE BEING SENT** to jdan4sure@yahoo.com

**üõãÔ∏è MATCHING OTTOMAN OPTIONS:**

Great news! The Repose Avenue collection has a perfect matching ottoman:

**Repose Avenue Ottoman - Defender Sand**
‚Ä¢ Same fabric and color as your sectional
‚Ä¢ Power storage with USB charging ports
‚Ä¢ Matches the dual power functionality
‚Ä¢ Dimensions: 24"W x 18"D x 18"H
‚Ä¢ Price: $299.99

**SPECIAL OFFER FOR EXISTING CUSTOMERS:**
Since you're already part of the Woodstock family, I can offer you:
‚Ä¢ 15% discount (saves you $45)
‚Ä¢ Free delivery (normally $49)
‚Ä¢ **Your price: $254.99 delivered**

The ottoman would complement your sectional perfectly and provide extra storage plus charging capability!

Would you like me to add this to a new order, or do you have other questions about your current sectional?

üë© CUSTOMER: That sounds great! But I want to make sure the clicking stops first. Can you call me if it doesn't get better in two weeks?

ü§ñ SYSTEM: **Absolutely, Janice!**
